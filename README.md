# Refactoring - Fowler (WIP)

My study notes from reading [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Fowler](https://www.amazon.ca/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=martin+fowler&qid=1608616449&sr=8-1)



# Tips

1. When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easier to add the feature, then add the feature. (page 4)
2. Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking. (page 5)
3. Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where the bug is. (page 8)
4. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that human can understand. (page 10)
5. When programming, follow the camping rule: Always leave the code base healthier than when you found it. (page 34)
6. The true test of how good code is how easy it is to change it. (page 43)
7. You have to refactor when you run into ugly code -- but excellent code needs plenty of refactoring too (page 52)
8. The whole purpose of refactoring is to make us program faster, producing more value with less effort (page 56)
9. When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to refactor the code so that any comment becomes superfluous. (page 84)
10. Make sure all tests are fully automatic and that they check their own results. (page 86)
11. A suite of tests is a powerful bug detector that decapitates the time it takes to find bugs. (page 86)
12. Always make sure a test will fail when it should. (page 91)
